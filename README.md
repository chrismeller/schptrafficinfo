SCHP Traffic Info
=================
This is a very basic script to grab and parse out the table provided by the South Carolina Highway Patrol that lists [live traffic information](http://www.scdps.gov/schp/schpwebcad/Default.aspx).

Currently, no real reason. I'm saving off everything to a SQLite database for my own evil future use. We'll see what comes of it.
